<h1>Pebble game</h1>

<div>
<p>
The goal of this puzzle game is to put all the red pebbles in the
first box by following one simple rule: <em>a box can be emptied only if
the number of pebbles in it is equal to the number of the box itself</em>;
when a box is emptied, its pebbles are distributed equally on all the
boxes to its left.
</p>

<p>
Click on pebbles to empty the corresponding box.

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is this puzzle solvable? If yes, give the order of the boxes to
  follow in emptying the boxes.</p>

<h3>Answer</h3>

<p>A puzzle is solvable only when the winning strategy is applicable
until the end. The winning strategy chooses always the lowest index
box which can be emptied. In fact, when two boxes can be chosen, if
one empties the highest one, the lower will be blocked forever.</p>

<h2>Alternative question</h2>

<p>Give a solvable puzzle with a total of 5 pebbles.</p>

<h3>Answer</h3>

<pre>1,1,3,0,0,0,0</pre>

<h2>Alternative question</h2>

<p>Which is the maximum number of pebbles for a solvable puzzle?</p>

<h3>Answer</h3>

There are only 21 (22 if you consider the trivial one) solvable
puzzles. The maximum number of pebbles in solvable puzzles is 21.
