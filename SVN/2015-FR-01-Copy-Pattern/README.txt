2015-FR-01: Comments by Group 8

A general comment first:

It is very hard to work on a task where initially only an image is available.  We like this task a lot, but in future workshops, tasks of this kind need to be submitted in a different form.

Now for more specific comments:

1. 
It is very important to understand that the directions "right", "left", "up", and "down" are meant absolute, instead of relative to where the "point" is heading.  
Therefore, we recommend to add an image showing these directions.  We have produced a compass image (compass.svg/png) for this purpose.  
Also, we recommend to use "make 1 step" instead of "walk 1 step". "Walk" seems to express that you are heading somewhere (to the goal of your walk) and that changing directions happens relative to your initial direction. In contrast, "make a step" is closer to having an initial position (regardless of where you are heading) and making absolute moves.

2.
In the hard version, the meaning of "S" needs to be briefly explained, like:  
>>Note that S is a placeholder for a number; this number is called "value of S". The value of S may change. Initially, the value of S is 1.<<

3.
The "It's Informatics" part is too simple and needs to be expanded.
